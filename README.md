1.The English language consists of consonants and vowels (a, e, i, o, u). When one or more vowels appear together, we refer to them as a vowel cluster. For example, in the word "beautiful," there are vowel clusters "eau," "i," and "u," resulting in three vowel clusters.
Input: beautiful

Run this program:
```bash
node vowelClusters.js
